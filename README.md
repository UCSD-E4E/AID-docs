### Fork of BirdNET-lite the Cornell state of the art multi-class bird classifier
- https://github.com/UCSD-E4E/BirdNET-Lite
- We have added in some features for batch processing and will implement some other parameters to customize this repository for our needs.

### Repository that gives nice HTML map output based on Microfaune Global Scores
- https://github.com/nishantbalaji/e4e-data-visualization
- Scripts used for this blogpost: http://e4e.ucsd.edu/news-and-updates/measuring-bird-presence-in-the-peruvian-amazon-using-neural-network-predictions
- Can technically be used for things beyond the Microfaune Global Scores
- Credit to Matthew Mercurio and Nishant Balaji
### Repository that allows us to compare the annotations we collect from Pyrenote via unsupervised clustering
- https://github.com/UCSD-E4E/Crowdsourced_Audio_Annotation_Unsupervised_Clustering_Analysis
- Hope is that we can find outliers, compare how individuals annotate, and compare how people annotate different species
